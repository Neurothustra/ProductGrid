# ProductGrid
A simple web app that presents data in a WebGrid using .Net MVC with Razor, Entity Framework and Code First.
The project uses the default .Net MVC scaffolding with up-to-date versions of NuGet, jQuery, Entity Framework, .Net, bootstrap & modernizr. The sole purpose is to demonstrate the use of the WebGrid object instead of the default HTML helper-embedded table that gets generated by Visual Studio.

Since the project uses Code First, no database needs to be connected in the web.config, you should be able to run it immediately. You will need SQL Server or SQL Server Express installed.
